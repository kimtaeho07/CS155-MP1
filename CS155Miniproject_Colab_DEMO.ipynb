        "Numerical ML models cannot take categorical data, input features must be in a *numerical* format. Therefore, we must choose how to \"encode\" our categorical and date data. Due to the number of DISTINCT features in the FIPS columns (too many for one-hot encoding, which would increase our dimensions by nearly 200), we choose to *label-encode* these categories (each distinct category gets its own integer), which pandas has readily-built functions to accomplish. This gives us the added benefit of turning `NaN`s into their *own* category, in case the choice by the original scribe to leave out a label is also indicative of a trend in the data. This also means we do not have to excise these values from the data set, and therefore have more training data to work with.\r\n",

Therefore, we must also encode the categories of the training set according to the categories of the training set (this results in a few more `NaN`s since there are more distinct categories in the test data than the training data, but we have handled those by giving them their own category)."

This permits the data to reflect seasonal trends, and account for year-over-year variability in fires (for instance, if we know the summer months are particularly problematic, then the summer range of days-of-the-year will capture this information in the aggregate, rather than trying to split it over month and year and see large variability in some months/years vs others)."

Therefore, it is usually helpful to *standardize* (give the z-score of the data, i.e. scale it to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1) or *0-1 scale* (make the minimum zero and the maximum 1) the numerical data of the features, or at least make sure the majority of each feature lies in a similar-order range. Therefore, we will also scale/standardize our numerical features to lie in a similar range (however, we will not do this to the categorical data, as \"squishing\" the trends in categories closer together is precisely what we do *not* want our model to deal with, and these shall remain untouched to permit wider distances between categories in the feature space).\r\n",

        "Another point to consider is that some of our variables may be *correlated*. There is nothing inherently evil about correlation between predictive features, but there are two downsides. Unless they are explicitly desired by the user, correlation between features can sometimes imapct model performance (correlations mean the model has a harder time telling the \"true\" contribution of each feature *separately* to the result, since the changes in one feature that affect the result are also matched by correlated changes in other features). Furthermore, the more correlated features are, the less data one of the features relatively provides to the model (its impact on the result is already captured by other features), and therefore it may be more advantageous to sacrifice a small amount of relative informaiton in favor of a decreased dimension size. Therefore, unless explicitly desired, we can also take a look at the correlation between features and choose (or not choose) to drop any highly-correlated (absolute value greater than 2/3) features, by visualizing a Pearson correlation matrix between all our now-numerical features:"

        "The results show us that Latitude and longitude are relatively highly correlated (but that's okay, we want these features anyway, and want to investigate whether there are more subtle trends between smaller values of the latitude and longitude, beyond the macroscopic correlation. This is also to be expected, because the data are either from California or Georgia, which will create artificial correlation between the data we have to work with, since George is more south-west than California), but we also see that `FIPCOD_CAT` (our categorized FIP codes) is highly correlated to longiditude and latitude. In this case, since we care more about longitude, we choose to drop `FIPCOD_CAT` from the model in favor of downsizing the input dimensions. This leaves behind no highly-correlated variables that we do not explicitly desire."

To evaluate the model performance, we choose to use the same AUC score from the competition, in the hopes that increasing the AUC score on the validation sets will also indicate a high AUC on the testing data. We also tried to use simpler (low-tree) models, to prevent overfitting of the testing data, and sample the training data instead of using the entire data set at once (both again to avoid overfitting, and also to speed up the training process).\r\n",

Instead, we present the training of our two submitted models with optimal hyperparameters below, that will be our submitted models for the competition, and will leave hyperparameter discussion to the report."
